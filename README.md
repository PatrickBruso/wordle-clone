# wordle-clone

Thoughts on development:

* Scrape dictionary for words or obtain large list of words
* Three different modes (easy: 4 letters, medium: 5 letters, hard: 6 letters)
* Set up database with list of words to randomly select proper word and avoid repeats
* Keep track of user stats
* Front-end (pyncone?)
